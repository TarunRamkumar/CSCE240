Instructions: 
    If an invalid input is detected, the code runs with the default values.
    The code assumes that the numbers are in no particular order, and decides which numbers to use as r or in respectively in the combination formula. 
    Code was tested with and valid for the following cases: 
        "5"
        "5 4"
        "5 ben"
        "ben"
        "5 4 compare"
        "5 4 ben"
        "hello how was your day"
