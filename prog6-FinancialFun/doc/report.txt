Overall, combining PA1 and PA4 was relatively simple, as I just needed to scrape the files rather than preloading them into the directory. However, PA5 was difficult to implement, as I had originally coded it as a 
CLI, which could not be combined with the matching algorithm. I ended up using parts of Dev's PA5, which made it easier to combine with my UI. The trickiest part was calling the logging function after my part was matched, 
because originally I would just retrieve the relative part of the file once a match was found.
