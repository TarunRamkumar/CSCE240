Welcome to the Email Information Extractor 9000! This program allows you to put in any email header and find specific information about it.

In order to use this program successfully, you must follow these instructions:

    - If the header contains the same part multiple times, it will return the first instance of the part.
    - The input file can be changed while the code is being run, however make sure that the header is valid and the file only contains one header.
